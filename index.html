							<h3>Description</h3>
							<p>In this project, an AI-Enabled Fin TechB2B Order Management Application has been built using regression model to predict if the payment of
								order will be delayed or not. This management system is a tool or platform that tracks sales, orders, inventory, and fulfillment as well as
								enables the people, processes, and partnerships necessary for products to find their way to the customers who bought them. The main
								purpose of the project is to manage the Account Receivable department in a straightforward, smooth and efficient way. The account
								managers will be able to collect payments from customers for their past due invoices. Reminders and follow ups can be sent to the
								customers for payments to be made in a timely manner. They can look after the entire process of getting the cash inflow and also help the
								company get paid for the services and products supplied.</p>
